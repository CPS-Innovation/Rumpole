# Rumpole UI

## Architecture/Code decisions

- using `gds-react-jsx`
- mocking with `msw`
- using `cypress` for integration testing
  - e2e tests, and where cypress kicks off in the pipelines?
- `prettier` - as per https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html#summary keep the version number in `package.json` fixed to avoid formatting differences between devs
